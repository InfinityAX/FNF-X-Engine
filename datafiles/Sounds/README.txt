This is where you place your own sound files that you want to use in your mod (NOT SONGS). Don't forget to add the sound to sounds.txt. Use the formatting below.

[EXAMPLE]		<- Sound name
SOUND FILE="EXAMPLE"	<- Sound file (omit extension, only .ogg files accepted)
PRIORITY="0.000000"	<- Sound priority (higher the priority, the less likely gamemaker will drop the audio)
LOOP="1.000000"		<- Loop sound (0 for no, other for yes)
[EXAMPLE2]
SOUND FILE="EXAMPLE2"
PRIORITY="0.000000"
LOOP="0.000000"
