This is where you place your own custom font files that you want to use system wide for your mod. Don't forget to add the font to d_fonts.txt. Use the formating below.

EXAMPLE.tff		<- Font file name including the extension for system font
20				<- System font size
0				<- Bold the system font (0 for no, 1 for yes)
0				<- Italic the system font (0 for no, 1 for yes)
32				<- First character in the system font (not recommended to change)
128				<- Last character in the system font (not recommended to change)
0				<- AA for the system font (0 for no, 1 for yes)
1				<- X scale multiply for text using the system font
1				<- Y scale multiply for text using the system font
White			<- System font colour

NOTE: Custom menu fonts function will be added in a future version.
